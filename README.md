Newtorking Workshop

First off, we want to say thank you for joining us on this day. We appreciate you all staying until the end of the meeting. This was an information-packed session, so we hope that you managed to learn of many new opportunities that we mentioned in our slides. Below, you will find the recording to the meeting, the presentation that we made/used for this workshop and any additional files that we prepared for you. Just to recap what this meeting was about, we talked about being a JJAY student/Navigating Campus, Extracurricular Opportunities at John Jay and outside of John Jay, and Resume & Behavioral/Technical Interview tips. We loved that many of you had plenty of questions at the end of the meeting. We hope we managed to answer all of your questions. If you have any more questions you can email us or reach out to us on discord.
